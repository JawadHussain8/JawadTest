It functions as an online code editor and open-source learning environment, where developers can create code snippets, called "pens," and test them. It was founded in 2012 by full-stack developers Alex Vazquez and Tim Sabat and front-end designer Chris Coyier.[2] Its employees work remotely, rarely all meeting together in person. CodePen is one of the largest communities for web designers and developers to showcase their coding skills,[3] with an estimated 330,000[4] registered users and 16.9 million monthly visitors. </p>
